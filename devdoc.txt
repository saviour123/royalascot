WHAT WE DO

We are the commercial unit of K-LAN GROUP of companies. We support other subsidiaries of the group in medical outreach and fundraising. We support Medmatrix Mutual Health Scheme (a subsidiary) by contributing $0.20 or GHC0.80 or more from every bottle of Equate Body lotion we sell.

We produce and sell souvenirs (Polo and T Shirts, lapel, wristbands, pens, mugs etc) to raise additional fund towards the medical outreach for children in Africa, with Ghana as a pilot project.

We are looking forward to using our website as an advert platform to generate additional revenue in support of the medical care for children, paying medical bills for childhood cancers, hole-in-heart and tumors.
